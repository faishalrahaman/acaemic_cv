These files are examples of the academic CV. I have uploaded the Latex file with the Microsoft Word documents. You can read the medium post on how to make an academic CV easily 
 The Foldr CV Template contains the latex template, and the MS Word file is also there.  

I have written a blog post on Medium about preparing an Academic CV. The link is [https://medium.com/@faishalrahaman/how-to-prepare-an-academic-cv-for-the-scholarship-e78d9225bc3b].
